// Creating the sentence of at least five words and a period
const favMovie = "I love movies and a particular favorite of mine is Strictly Ballroom.";

// Creating the array with splits (separation) at the spaces between words
const movieArr = favMovie.split(' ');

// Console.log the third word in the array
console.log(movieArr[2]);

// EXPECTED RESULT:
// "movies" - this is the third word in the array created by splitting the sentence at the spaces between words
